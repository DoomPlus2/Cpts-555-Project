Functionality
Functionality includes suitability, accuracy, interoperability, and security.

Reliability
Reliability includes the maturity, fault tolerance, and recoverability.

Usability
Usability includes the understandability, learn ability, operability, and attractiveness.

Efficiency
Efficiency includes the time behaviour and resource utilization sub characteristics. Time behaviour sub-characteristic is very important in the wireless environment because the price of each minute of data transferring is very high, and the users will avoid expensive systems.

Maintainability
Maintainability includes the analyzability, changeability, stability, and testability sub-characteristics.

Portability
Portability includes the adaptability, install ability, co-existence, and replace ability sub- characteristics.

Quality
Quality in use is the user's view of quality.


Sugested Metrics are Functionality, Reliability, Usability and quality in use. These four can be defined mathematically as:
